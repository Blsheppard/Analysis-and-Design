# Analysis-and-Design
  In this course we were learning about the different data structures, what they do and how they work. We also learned how to implement them into our programs. The main problem I was solving was how to get my program to open and read a text file, then to sort the file contents into an ordered list. I am better at researching things than coding programs at the current moment, so I did alot of research on each data structure and how I might use them to get my code to perform the way I wanted it to. Understanding the different data structures are important because each one acts and behaves a little different, and has their own strengths. They each play their own particular role and serve it's own purpose. 
  In this assignment I espeically had a rough time getting my code to read from the text file. As I already mentioned above, I am far better at research,, so I researched how to open a file, and stackoverflow was a better resource for me to understand, I also found a couple youtube videos that helped fill in the blanks better. I think at the very least, I do have a better understanding of the data structures and which ones work better for different orientations of the features i plan to implement. This project has definetly strengthened my understanding of writing my programs and helped me to practice my ideas and how to implement them better.
